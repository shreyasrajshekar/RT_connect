# **Real-time Messaging App**

This project was built as part of GDG NMIT Round 2. The goal was to implement a real-time chat application with Firebase, handle offline states, and integrate push notifications.

## **🚀 Features Implemented**

Real-time messaging using Firebase Firestore.

Connection check → shows a popup if the user goes offline.

Basic UI for sending and receiving messages.

Demo video included.

## **⚠️ Limitations**

Push notifications (FCM) were attempted but not fully functional due to configuration issues. A simulated notification flow is shown in the demo video to represent intended behavior.

UI was generated/adapted with AI tools and customized for integration.

## **🔮 Future Improvements**

Fix FCM configuration and fully enable push notifications.

Add message read receipts and typing indicators.

Improve UI/UX with themes, emojis, and reactions.

Add authentication for multiple users.

## **🛠️ Tech Stack**

React Native (Expo)

Firebase Firestore for real-time data

Firebase Authentication (optional for future)

FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) for push notifications
